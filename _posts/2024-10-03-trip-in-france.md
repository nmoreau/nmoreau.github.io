Often times, people are traveling to France and asking "any recommendation ?". 
Here are some notes, thoughts and ideas. 

## What to plan for

Couple guiding principles : 
- Prioritize slow travel, soaking into the culture, instead of rushing
- Don't plan Everything. Give some space to improvise and wander based on what you need / want. The best memories often come from unplanned events
- It's OK to skip guide books "must see"

## Timing
- 1 Week : Paris, Versailles and Chateaux de la Loire (close to where I am born)
- 2 Weeks : Paris, Avignon, Aix, Marseille.

I do not recommend to go to Nice, Cannes and around. Why ? It's busy, too much US tourists, and not much to see IMO (this is a bit controversial I admit). If you go there wander around Antibes.

## General logistics guidance
- A good alternative to Booking for Hotels 
    - [Relais et Chateaux](https://www.relaischateaux.com/us/) a nice brand offering a collection of unique special hotels and "veilles demeures"
- Restaurants : Beyond the classics look for [The Fork](https://Thefork.com) or the [Guide Michelin](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en) especially the "Gros Bib" label which offers unbeatable price / quality for excellent places
- Moving : Train (TGV) is excellent to go to Tours (Chateaux de la Loire) or to go to Lyon, Avignon, Aix, Marseille. 
- Renting a Car : Sixt offers one ways anywhere in France for 120 Euros. Worth considering to combine Car + Train or Air


## What to Do in Paris
My top of mind todo list includes
- Louvre, Jardin des Tuileries and Champs Elysees
- Eiffel Tower (walk up the stairs, donâ€™t take the elevator). 2 hours max.
- The old Paris (1st and 2nd arrondissement) : Les Halles, rue Montorgueuil, le Grand Palais, le Louis Vuitton museum
- Wandering in Le quartier Latin 
- Les Puces de Saint Ouen (Metro Saint Ouen) - Wild bazar 
- Chateau de Versailles (almost a full day) - RER to Versailles

## Les Chateaux de la Loire et la Touraine
This part (Touraine) is located on both side of the Loire valley where castles from the formers "Roi de France" are located
- Take the train (TGV) to Tours than rent a Car in Tours.
- Then tour les [Chateaux de la Loire](https://www.esprit-de-france.com/en/blog/itinerary-discovering-the-chateaux-de-la-loire). You can find many itineraries online and suggestions, as well as accommodation. This is the one time opportunity to book hotels which are literally some castles.
- Excellent tables all around.

## Lyon Avignon, Marseille, Les Calanques
This corridor located between Lyon and Nice is the most diverse and nice looking part of France, with excellent wine, small villages and breathtaking landscape.
- Take the Train to Lyon or Avignon or Aix en Provence (Same TGV that goes all the way to Marseille)
- Avignon and le Palais des Papes. Wine all around.
- (Bonus) Nimes et ses Arenes. Le Pont du Gard is a popular stop, with Uzes
- Le [Luberon](https://www.theluberon.com/villages/) and the villages 
- Aix en Provence market (look for the days)
- Marseille and le vieux port, la vieille ville
- (Bonus) - La Camargue National Park (Arles, Saint Marie de la Mer)
- MUST DO: Les [Calanques](https://www.calanques-parcnational.fr/en): Spend a day there 1h walking from Luminy or Cassis - Watch for reservations that may be needed in summer
- Port de Cassis (spend a night there)
- Push to Nice or Antibes if you have time, or really want to. Plenty of small villages on the way, including Saint Tropez
- Antibes : take an accommodation in the old City of Antibes (intra-muros)
- Ride the train back to Paris from Marseille or Aix. From Nice, take a flight
